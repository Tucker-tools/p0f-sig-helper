# p0f-sig-helper
The tool will generate a RAW and REDUCED SIG and download the current p0f Signature file and compare it to the one it generates.  It will give a list of recommended signatures from the p0f.fp at the end.

It uses all standard tools but if you don't have "curl" installed you will need that.
